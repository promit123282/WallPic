				Manual Mode is a very powerful & complicated mode of camera.It gives you the ability to control evevrythings like aperture, shutter speed, iso, whitebalance etc. But before knowing about mannual mode we have to know about all parameters like aperture, shutter speed ,iso etc.If you know all of these then you can go straight toward Modes.

			<h2>Usages:-</h2>
			<p>I will dicuss all of the usages shortly thus you can remember very easily.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				  <h3>
				  	Aperture:-
				  </h3>
				  <p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				Higher aperture means the image will be brighter but it will create shallow depth of field.That's mean the background of the focused object will be more blurred.We have to control other parameters to prevent over-exposed image.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				Lower aperture means the image will be darker but it will create higher depth of field.That's mean the background of that focused object will be more visible.We have to control other parameters to prevent under-exposed image.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  			    Sometimes lower aperture gives sharper images than higher aperture.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  	</ul>
				  </p>	
				</li>
				<li>
				  <h3>
				  	Shutter-Speed:-
				  </h3>
				  <p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  			   Higher Shutter-speed means the image will be captured very quickly just in a fraction of a second like 1/400s or 1/1000s etc.But the image will be darker and it is used to click the picture of a moving object to capture it like a still object.We have to control other parameters to prevent under-exposed image.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  			   Lower Shutter-speed means the image will be captured slowly with a long length of time like 1/10s or 2s or 5s etc.But the image will be brighter and basically it is used to take photos at low light condition.We have to control other parameters to prevent over-exposed image.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  	</ul>
				  </p>	
				</li>
				<li>
				  <h3>
				  	Iso:-
				  </h3>
				  <p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				Higher Iso means brighter image will be produced but remember with higher iso the image will be more noisy and bad.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				Lower Iso means darker image will be produced but remember with lower iso the image will be less noisy and good but don't make Iso lower than 64 because then it may produce smoother image.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				I will recommend you to keep Iso of your camera between 80 to 400 according to the lighting condition.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  	</ul>
				  </p>	
				</li>

				<li>
				  <h3>
				  	White-balance:-
				  </h3>
				  <p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				Many of us keep the White-balance to auto.But it is not good, I will recommend you to choose the White-balance manually according to the lighting situation or scene.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				Like you are outside at daytime ,then choose Daylight white-balance,or you are under a tubelight or any types of flurosent bulb then choose flurosent etc.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				You can also choose the full manual white-balance setting.There just remember if you increase the temparate or I mean the white-balance slide the image will be yellowish and if you decrease the image will be bluish.Now According to the lighting condition choose it.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  	</ul>
				  </p>	
				</li>

				<li>
				  <h3>
				  	Metering-Mode:-
				  </h3>
				  <p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				According to the metering mode you have selected, the camera will adjust exposure depending upon the area of your image.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				Suppose you have selected centre-weighted average metering mode then the camera will adjust the exposure depending upon the center of your image.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			<P>
				  				I will suggest you to select multi-zone or spot metering mode and select the multi-zones or spot upon the object you want to focus. Thus the object will be clearer and well exposed.
				  			</P>
				  		</li>
				  	</ul>
