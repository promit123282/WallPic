				What is Photography?-
			</h2>
			<p>
				<font color="#B0FFA1">"Photography"</font> is an art where the light coming from outside passes through the very small hole of aperture of a camera and it is captured by a <font color="#B0FFA1">"Image Sensor"</font> or by a light-sensitive material such as <font color="#B0FFA1">"Photographic film"</font>.Thus the image is captured and it makes a meaningful scene.At the past we have used <font color="#B0FFA1">"Photographic film"</font> but now basically we are using <font color="#B0FFA1">"Image Sensor"</font>.From black&white <font color="#B0FFA1">"Photographic Film"</font> we have created images by <font color="#B0FFA1">"Darkroom Process"</font> but now the picture is generated directly and <font color="#B0FFA1">"Digitally"</font>.
