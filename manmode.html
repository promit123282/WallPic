				Manual Mode is a very powerful & complicated mode of camera.It gives you the ability to control evevrythings like aperture, shutter speed, iso, whitebalance etc. But before knowing about mannual mode we have to know about all parameters like aperture, shutter speed ,iso etc.If you know all of these then you can go straight toward Modes.

			<h2>Parameters:-</h2>
			<ol type="i">
				<li>
				<h3>
					Aperture:-
				</h3>
				<p>
					Aperture means a hole which is made by small metal plates. Through this hole light comes toward camera sensor and makes the picture.This is a very important subject of manual mode. Aperture is denoted by f/ like f/8,f/4.8.If f no is small then aperture will be big . If f no is big then aperture will be small. It means between f/4.8 and f/5.6 ,f/4.8 wll create bigger aperture hole than f/5.6.
					Now look at the Usages & Modes section for more information and its usage.

				<h3>
					Shutter Speed:-
				</h3>
				<p>
					Shutter speed means the lenth of time when a film or digital sensor of a camera is exposed to light. The lenth of time when the shutter of a camera is opened for taking a photo.We control shutter speed to take various types of pictures.When we click the shutter button the Aperture hole will take the size we have given or in auto mode which the camera will decide and remain same for that time length for shutter speed and then it closes at that time length the picture is captured . Now look at the Usages & Modes section for more information and its usage.
				</p>

				<h3>
					Iso:-
				</h3>
				<p>
					Iso means the sensivity of your camera sensor to light. A lower iso means less sensivity to light,and higher iso means higher sensitivity to light. Now look at the Usages & Modes section for more information and its usage.
				</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<h3>
					White-balance:-
				</h3>
				<p>
					We use many types of white balance to balance colour & temparature according to the light of nature or outside.The measurement unit of White-balance is k.If you increase White-balance the image will be created in a yellow tone and for lower iso the image will be create in a blue tone. Now look at the Usages & Modes section for more information and its usage.
				</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<h3>
					Metering:-
				</h3>
				<p>
					In photography, the metering mode refers to the way in which a camera determines exposure. Cameras generally allow the user to select between spot, center-weighted average or Matrix Metering metering modes. In center-weighted average metering mode the camera sensor determines exposure according to the center of image. In spot metering mode the camera sensor determines exposure according to the spot of image you have selected. In Matrix Metering metering mode the camera sensor determines exposure according to the focus points of image you have selected. Now look at the Usages & Modes section for more information and its usage.
